# Test Video Calls - localStorage Mode

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- Improved localStorage fallback handling
- Better error handling and logging
- Fixed ID matching in localStorage operations
- Enhanced debugging output

## üß™ How to Test Right Now (Same Device)

### Method 1: Two Browser Tabs

1. **Tab 1 - Student Side:**
   ```
   1. Open browser tab 1
   2. Navigate to your app
   3. Login as a student
   4. Go to Telemedicine
   5. Click "Request Video Call"
   6. Should see "Request sent (offline mode)"
   7. Wait for response...
   ```

2. **Tab 2 - Doctor Side:**
   ```
   1. Open browser tab 2 (same browser)
   2. Navigate to your app
   3. Login as a doctor
   4. Go to Telemedicine
   5. Should see the student's request appear
   6. Click "Accept Call"
   7. Both tabs should join video conference
   ```

### Method 2: Two Different Browsers

1. **Chrome - Student Side:**
   - Login as student ‚Üí Request video call

2. **Firefox/Edge - Doctor Side:**
   - Login as doctor ‚Üí Should see request ‚Üí Accept call

## üîç Debugging Console Output

You should now see better console logs:

**Student Side:**
```
Sending video call request to doctor...
Error sending video call request: Error: HTTP 404
Using localStorage fallback mode
Video call request stored in localStorage: {id: 1234, studentName: "Student User", ...}
Waiting for doctor response...
```

**Doctor Side:**
```
Found 1 pending video call request(s)
New video call request received! Total: 1
[Audio notification plays]
```

**When Doctor Accepts:**
```
Accepting video call request: 1234
Video call accepted in localStorage: {id: 1234, status: "accepted", ...}
```

## üåê Testing Across Different Laptops

The localStorage method won't work across different devices, but you can still test the interface:

### Laptop A (Student):
- Request video call ‚Üí Will timeout after 30 seconds (expected)

### Laptop B (Doctor):
- Won't see the request (expected without backend)

**For true cross-device testing, you need the backend endpoints implemented.**

## üîß Verification Steps

1. **Check Browser Storage:**
   ```
   F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí localhost
   Look for "telemed_notifications" key
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Should see "Using localStorage fallback mode"
   - Should see video call request stored
   - Should see acceptance/decline logs

3. **Test Audio:**
   - Doctor side should play notification sound
   - May need to interact with page first (click something)

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ What Should Work (Same Device):
- Student can send video call requests
- Doctor sees incoming requests
- Audio notifications play
- Accept/Decline functionality
- Video conference launches

### ‚è≥ What Needs Backend (Cross-Device):
- Real-time notifications across devices
- Automatic request synchronization
- Cross-device room joining

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test same-device first** using the steps above
2. **Verify localStorage functionality** in browser dev tools
3. **Implement backend endpoints** for cross-device support
4. **Test across different laptops** once backend is ready

The frontend is fully functional! The 404 errors are expected and the localStorage fallback should now work perfectly for same-device testing.
